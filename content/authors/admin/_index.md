Dr. Shizhu Liu is a Clinical Assistant Professor of Mathematics
at [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (NYU)](https://cims.nyu.edu/). Her Ph.D. study was advised by [Dr. Erwin Lutwak](https://cims.nyu.edu/people/profiles/LUTWAK_Erwin.html), [Dr. Gaoyong Zhang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~gaoyong/) and [Dr. Deane Yang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~yangd/). Her research interests are centered around Convex Geometry, Information Theory and Analytic Inequalities. 

In recent summers, Shizhu worked as a Data Science Consultant for a reinsurance company, where she discovered the power and excitement of working with data. She now applies analytics and data visualization to solve problems in business and higher education. For over 9 years, Shizhu has found joy in teaching undergraduate math courses at NYU and was awarded NYU's Golden Dozen Award for outstanding contribution to teaching. Shizhu also serves as faculty advisor for the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) NYU Chapter, coaches the NYU teams in Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) and Interdisiplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM), and hosts for NYU Undergraduate Math Modeling Workshop.

When not working, you might find Shizhu watching Broadway shows, practicing golf at Chelsea Piers, or swimming at NYU Palladium gym.
